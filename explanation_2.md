My implementation uses Recursion which will behave like a stack. I'd say the data structure of this will be stack. This will do a complete search for every directory and its branches using recursion, so, the time complexity will be O(n) as it loops over to each branch of the directories once and the space complexity will be O(n) as "n" is the number of directories that it's being yielded.
