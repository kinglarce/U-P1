My implementation uses Recursion which is not a data structure per se, so i'd say there's no data structure for this one. This will do a complete search for every directory and its branches using recursion, so, the time complexity will be O(n) as it loops over to each branch of the directories once and the space complexity will be O(n) as "n" is the number of directories that it's being yielded.
