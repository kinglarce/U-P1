The data structure used for this is Recursion since the pattern for looking through the directories is just the same. My implementation is a complete search for every directory and its branches using recursion, so, the time complexity will be O(2^n) as it loops over to each branch of the directories and do a recursive call and the space complexity will be O(nm) as "n" is the depth of the recursion and "m" for the function call.
