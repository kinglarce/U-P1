The data structure used for this is Recursion since the pattern for looking through the directories is just the same. My implementation is a complete search for every directory and its branches using recursion, so, the time complexity will be O(2^n) as it goes over to each branch of the directories and the space complexity will be O(n) as it depends on the file(s) that it can find.
