My implementation uses Recursion which uses stack for storing the frame object. I use list for storing the result so the data structure for this one is list for storing the result and call stack for storing the stack frames of the recursive calls. This will do a complete search for every directory and its branches using recursion, so, the time complexity will be O(n) as it loops over to each branch of the directories once and the space complexity will be O(n) as "n" is the number of directories that it's being yielded.
