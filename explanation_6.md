It's already a LinkedList problem, so the data structure to be used here is LinkedList with Hashing which is used on each block. My implementation for both union and intersection is traversing on the two LinkedList and just collection the uniques from the two LinkedList. So, the time complexity for both union and intersection is O(n) as "n" is the LinkedList elements from the two LinkedList and the space complexity is O(n) as "n" is unique elements for union and common elements found in the intersection.
