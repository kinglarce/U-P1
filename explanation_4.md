The data structure used for this is Recursion since the pattern for looking through the groups is just the same. My implementation is to traverse on the tree of groups then the time complexity will be O(2^n) as it loops over to each group of groups and do a recursive call and the space complexity will be O(nm) as "n" is the depth of the recursion and "m" for the function call.
