My implementation uses Recursion which uses stack for storing the frame object. So the data structure for this one is stack for storing the stack frames of the recursive calls. This will do a traverse on the tree of groups then the time complexity will be O(n) as it loops over to each group of groups using recursion and the space complexity will be O(n) as "n" is the number of groups that it's being yielded.
