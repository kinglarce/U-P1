My implementation uses Recursion which is not a data structure per se, so i'd say there's no data structure for this one. This will do a traverse on the tree of groups then the time complexity will be O(n) as it loops over to each group of groups using recursion and the space complexity will be O(n) as "n" is the number of groups that it's being yielded.
