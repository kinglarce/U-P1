In the problem, it says that "All operations must take O(1) time" and from that, the obvious answer is hashmap where we already have a unique key and we can just grab the value from the key which will take O(1). 

Second, I want some data structure that can grab something from the middle and put it in the head as well as access something directly without traversing, so the data structure that I used is Link is LinkedList, and to be specific, I use doubly LinkedList so that is easy to connect the previous and next node without traversing the whole LinkedList in combination with Map for access value directly without traversing.

So, in my implementation, I can expect the time complexity of accessing and setting of data will take O(1) and space complexity will take O(n) because it depends on the capacity that I set.
